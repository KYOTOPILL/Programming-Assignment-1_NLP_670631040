i
down
rabbithole
alice
beginning
get
very
tired
sitting
her
sister
bank
having
nothing
do
once
or
twice
she
had
peeped
into
book
her
sister
reading
but
had
no
pictures
or
conversations
what
use
book
thought
alice
without
pictures
or
conversation
so
she
considering
her
own
mind
well
she
could
hot
day
made
her
feel
very
sleepy
stupid
whether
pleasure
making
daisychain
would
be
worth
trouble
getting
up
picking
daisies
when
suddenly
white
rabbit
pink
eyes
ran
close
her
there
nothing
so
very
remarkable
nor
did
alice
think
so
very
much
out
way
hear
rabbit
say
itself
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
shall
be
late
when
she
thought
over
afterwards
occurred
her
she
ought
have
wondered
at
but
at
time
all
seemed
quite
natural
but
when
rabbit
actually
took
watch
out
its
waistcoat
pocket
looked
at
then
hurried
alice
started
her
feet
flashed
across
her
mind
she
had
never
before
seen
rabbit
either
waistcoatpocket
or
watch
take
out
burning
curiosity
she
ran
across
field
after
fortunately
just
time
see
pop
down
large
rabbithole
under
hedge
another
moment
down
went
alice
after
never
once
considering
how
world
she
get
out
again
rabbithole
went
straight
like
tunnel
some
way
then
dipped
suddenly
down
so
suddenly
alice
had
not
moment
think
about
stopping
herself
before
she
found
herself
falling
down
very
deep
well
either
well
very
deep
or
she
fell
very
slowly
she
had
plenty
time
she
went
down
look
about
her
wonder
what
going
happen
next
first
she
tried
look
down
make
out
what
she
coming
but
too
dark
see
anything
then
she
looked
at
sides
well
noticed
they
were
filled
cupboards
bookshelves
here
there
she
saw
maps
pictures
hung
upon
pegs
she
took
down
jar
from
one
shelves
she
passed
labelled
orange
marmalade
but
her
great
disappointment
empty
she
did
not
like
drop
jar
fear
killing
somebody
so
managed
put
into
one
cupboards
she
fell
past
well
thought
alice
herself
after
such
fall
i
shall
think
nothing
tumbling
down
stairs
how
brave
theyll
all
think
me
at
home
why
i
wouldnt
say
anything
about
even
if
i
fell
off
top
house
which
very
likely
true
down
down
down
would
fall
never
come
an
end
i
wonder
how
many
miles
ive
fallen
time
she
said
aloud
i
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
centre
earth
let
me
see
would
be
four
thousand
miles
down
i
think
you
see
alice
had
learnt
several
things
sort
her
lessons
schoolroom
though
not
very
good
opportunity
showing
off
her
knowledge
there
no
one
listen
her
still
good
practice
say
over
yes
thats
about
right
distancebut
then
i
wonder
what
latitude
or
longitude
ive
got
alice
had
no
idea
what
latitude
or
longitude
either
but
thought
they
were
nice
grand
words
say
presently
she
began
again
i
wonder
if
i
shall
fall
right
through
earth
how
funny
itll
seem
come
out
among
people
walk
their
heads
downward
antipathies
i
think
she
rather
glad
there
no
one
listening
time
didnt
sound
at
all
right
word
but
i
shall
have
ask
them
what
name
country
you
know
please
maam
new
zealand
or
australia
she
tried
curtsey
she
spokefancy
curtseying
youre
falling
through
air
do
you
think
you
could
manage
what
an
ignorant
little
girl
shell
think
me
asking
no
itll
never
do
ask
perhaps
i
shall
see
written
up
somewhere
down
down
down
there
nothing
else
do
so
alice
soon
began
talking
again
dinahll
miss
me
very
much
tonight
i
should
think
dinah
cat
i
hope
theyll
remember
her
saucer
milk
at
teatime
dinah
my
dear
i
wish
you
were
down
here
me
there
are
no
mice
air
im
afraid
but
you
might
catch
bat
thats
very
like
mouse
you
know
but
do
cats
eat
bats
i
wonder
here
alice
began
get
rather
sleepy
went
saying
herself
dreamy
sort
way
do
cats
eat
bats
do
cats
eat
bats
sometimes
do
bats
eat
cats
you
see
she
couldnt
answer
either
question
didnt
much
matter
which
way
she
put
she
felt
she
dozing
off
had
just
begun
dream
she
walking
hand
hand
dinah
saying
her
very
earnestly
now
dinah
tell
me
truth
did
you
ever
eat
bat
when
suddenly
thump
thump
down
she
came
upon
heap
sticks
dry
leaves
fall
over
alice
not
bit
hurt
she
jumped
up
her
feet
moment
she
looked
up
but
all
dark
overhead
before
her
another
long
passage
white
rabbit
still
sight
hurrying
down
there
not
moment
be
lost
away
went
alice
like
wind
just
time
hear
say
turned
corner
oh
my
ears
whiskers
how
late
its
getting
she
close
behind
when
she
turned
corner
but
rabbit
no
longer
be
seen
she
found
herself
long
low
hall
which
lit
up
row
lamps
hanging
from
roof
there
were
doors
all
round
hall
but
they
were
all
locked
when
alice
had
been
all
way
down
one
side
up
other
trying
every
door
she
walked
sadly
down
middle
wondering
how
she
ever
get
out
again
suddenly
she
came
upon
little
threelegged
table
all
made
solid
glass
there
nothing
except
tiny
golden
key
alices
first
thought
might
belong
one
doors
hall
but
alas
either
locks
were
too
large
or
key
too
small
but
at
any
rate
would
not
open
any
them
however
second
time
round
she
came
upon
low
curtain
she
had
not
noticed
before
behind
little
door
about
fifteen
inches
high
she
tried
little
golden
key
lock
her
great
delight
fitted
alice
opened
door
found
led
into
small
passage
not
much
larger
than
rathole
she
knelt
down
looked
along
passage
into
loveliest
garden
you
ever
saw
how
she
longed
get
out
dark
hall
wander
about
among
those
beds
bright
flowers
those
cool
fountains
but
she
could
not
even
get
her
head
though
doorway
even
if
my
head
would
go
through
thought
poor
alice
would
be
very
little
use
without
my
shoulders
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
shut
up
like
telescope
i
think
i
could
if
i
only
know
how
begin
you
see
so
many
outoftheway
things
had
happened
lately
alice
had
begun
think
very
few
things
indeed
were
really
impossible
there
seemed
be
no
use
waiting
little
door
so
she
went
back
table
half
hoping
she
might
find
another
key
or
at
any
rate
book
rules
shutting
people
up
like
telescopes
time
she
found
little
bottle
which
certainly
not
here
before
said
alice
round
neck
bottle
paper
label
words
drink
me
beautifully
printed
large
letters
all
very
well
say
drink
me
but
wise
little
alice
not
going
do
hurry
no
ill
look
first
she
said
see
whether
its
marked
poison
or
not
she
had
read
several
nice
little
histories
about
children
who
had
got
burnt
eaten
up
wild
beasts
other
unpleasant
things
all
because
they
would
not
remember
simple
rules
their
friends
had
taught
them
such
redhot
poker
will
burn
you
if
you
hold
too
long
if
you
cut
your
finger
very
deeply
knife
usually
bleeds
she
had
never
forgotten
if
you
drink
much
from
bottle
marked
poison
almost
certain
disagree
you
sooner
or
later
however
bottle
not
marked
poison
so
alice
ventured
taste
finding
very
nice
had
fact
sort
mixed
flavour
cherrytart
custard
pineapple
roast
turkey
toffee
hot
buttered
toast
she
very
soon
finished
off
what
curious
feeling
said
alice
i
must
be
shutting
up
like
telescope
so
indeed
she
now
only
ten
inches
high
her
face
brightened
up
at
thought
she
now
right
size
going
though
little
door
into
lovely
garden
first
however
she
waited
few
minutes
see
if
she
going
shrink
any
further
she
felt
little
nervous
about
might
end
you
know
said
alice
herself
my
going
out
altogether
like
candle
i
wonder
what
i
should
be
like
then
she
tried
fancy
what
flame
candle
like
after
candle
blown
out
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
such
thing
after
while
finding
nothing
more
happened
she
decided
going
into
garden
at
once
but
alas
poor
alice
when
she
got
door
she
found
he
had
forgotten
little
golden
key
when
she
went
back
table
she
found
she
could
not
possibly
reach
she
could
see
quite
plainly
through
glass
she
tried
her
best
climb
up
one
legs
table
but
too
slippery
when
she
had
tired
herself
out
trying
poor
little
thing
sat
down
cried
come
theres
no
use
crying
like
said
alice
herself
rather
sharply
i
advise
you
leave
off
minute
she
generally
gave
herself
very
good
advice
though
she
very
seldom
followed
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
bring
tears
into
her
eyes
once
she
remembered
trying
box
her
own
ears
having
cheated
herself
game
croquet
she
playing
against
herself
curious
child
very
fond
pretending
be
two
people
but
its
no
use
now
thought
poor
alice
pretend
be
two
people
why
theres
hardly
enough
me
left
make
one
respectable
person
soon
her
eye
fell
little
glass
box
lying
under
table
she
opened
found
very
small
cake
which
words
eat
me
were
beautifully
marked
currants
well
ill
eat
said
alice
if
makes
me
grow
larger
i
can
reach
key
if
makes
me
grow
smaller
i
can
creep
under
door
so
either
way
ill
get
into
garden
i
dont
care
which
happens
she
ate
little
bit
said
anxiously
herself
which
way
which
way
holding
her
hand
top
her
head
feel
which
way
growing
she
quite
surprised
find
she
remained
same
size
be
sure
generally
happens
when
one
eats
cake
but
alice
had
got
so
much
into
way
expecting
nothing
but
outoftheway
things
happen
seemed
quite
dull
stupid
life
go
common
way
so
she
set
work
very
soon
finished
off
cake
chapter
ii
pool
tears
curiouser
curiouser
cried
alice
she
so
much
surprised
moment
she
quite
forgot
how
speak
good
english
now
im
opening
out
like
largest
telescope
ever
goodbye
feet
when
she
looked
down
at
her
feet
they
seemed
be
almost
out
sight
they
were
getting
so
far
off
oh
my
poor
little
feet
i
wonder
who
will
put
your
shoes
stockings

shant

too
far
off
trouble
myself
about

you
must
manage
best
way
you

but
i

them
thought
alice
or
perhaps
they
wont
walk
way
i
want
go
let
me
see
ill
give
them
new
pair
boots
every
christmas
she
went
planning
herself
how
she
would
manage
they
must
go
carrier
she
thought
how
funny
itll
seem
sending
presents
ones
own
feet
how
odd
directions
will
look
alices
right
foot
esq
hearthrug
near
fender
alices
love
oh

what
nonsense
im
talking
just
then
her
head
struck
against
roof
hall
fact
she
now
more
than
nine
feet
high
she
at
once
took
up
little
golden
key
hurried
off
garden
door
poor
alice
much
she
could
do
lying
down
one
side
look
through
into
garden
one
eye
but
get
through
more
hopeless
than
ever
she
sat
down
began
cry
again
you
ought
be
ashamed
yourself
said
alice
great
girl
like
you
she
might
well
say
go
crying
way
stop
moment
i
tell
you
but
she
went
all
same
shedding
gallons
tears
until
there
large
pool
all
round
her
about
four
inches
deep
reaching
half
down
hall
after
time
she
heard
little
pattering
feet
distance
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
see
what
coming
white
rabbit
returning
splendidly
dressed
pair
white
kid
gloves
one
hand
large
fan
other
he
came
trotting
along
great
hurry
muttering
himself
he
came
oh
duchess
duchess
oh
wont
she
be
savage
if
ive
kept
her
waiting
alice
felt
so
desperate
she
ready
ask
help
any
one
so
when
rabbit
came
near
her
she
began
low
timid
voice
if
you

sir
rabbit
started
violently
dropped
white
kid
gloves
fan
skurried
away
into
darkness
hard
he
could
go
alice
took
up
fan
gloves
hall
very
hot
she
kept
fanning
herself
all
time
she
went
talking

but
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
strange
words

how

crocodile
improve
his
shining
tail

cried
alice
sudden
burst
tears
i
do
wish

would
put
their
heads
down
i

so
very
tired
being
all
alone
here
she
said
she
looked
down
at
her
hands
surprised
see
she
had
put
one
rabbits
little
white
kid
gloves
while
she
talking
how
can
i
have
done
she
thought
i
must
be
growing
small
again
she
got
up
went
table
measure
herself
found
nearly
she
could
guess
she
now
about
two
feet
high
going
shrinking
rapidly
she
soon
found
out
cause
fan
she
holding
she
dropped
hastily
just
time
avoid
shrinking
away
altogether
narrow
escape
said
alice
good
deal
frightened
at
sudden
change
but
very
glad
find
herself
still
existence
now
garden
she
ran
all
speed
back
little
door
but
alas
little
door
shut
again
little
golden
key
lying
glass
table
before
things
are
worse
than
ever
thought
poor
child
i
never
so
small
before
never
i
declare
its
too
bad
she
said
these
words
her
foot
slipped
another
moment
splash
she
up
her
chin
salt
water
he
first
idea
she
had
somehow
fallen
into
sea
case
i
can
go
back
railway
she
said
herself
alice
had
been
seaside
once
her
life
had
come
general
conclusion
wherever
you
go
english
coast
you
find
number
bathing
machines
sea
some
children
digging
sand
wooden
spades
then
row
lodging
houses
behind
them
railway
station
however
she
soon
made
out
she
pool
tears
which
she
had
wept
when
she
nine
feet
high
i
wish
i
hadnt
cried
so
much
said
alice
she
swam
about
trying
find
her
way
out
i
shall
be
punished
now
i
suppose
being
drowned
my
own
tears
will
be
queer
thing
be
sure
however
everything
queer
today
just
then
she
heard
something
splashing
about
pool
little
way
off
she
swam
nearer
make
out
what
at
first
she
thought
must
be
walrus
or
hippopotamus
but
then
she
remembered
how
small
she
now
she
soon
made
out
only
mouse
had
slipped
like
herself
would
be
any
use
now
thought
alice
speak
mouse
everything
so
outoftheway
down
here
i
should
think
very
likely
can
talk
at
any
rate
theres
no
harm
trying
so
she
began
o
mouse
do
you
know
way
out
pool
i
am
very
tired
swimming
about
here
o
mouse
alice
thought
must
be
right
way
speaking
mouse
she
had
never
done
such
thing
before
but
she
remembered
having
seen
her
brothers
latin
grammar

mouse

rather
inquisitively

william
conqueror
all
her
knowledge
history
alice
had
no
very
clear
notion
how
long

anything

happened
so
she
began
again
ou
est
ma
chatte
which
first
sentence
her
french
lessonbook
mouse
gave
sudden
leap
out
water
seemed
quiver
all

natural
alice
find
herself
talking
familiarly
them
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
life
indeed
she
had
quite
long
argument
lory

at

turned
sulky
would
only
say

alice
would
not

away
but
they
began
running
when
they
liked
left
off
when
they
liked

not
easy
know
when
race
over
however
when
they
had
been
running
half
an
hour
or
so
were
quite
dry
again
dodo
suddenly
called
out
race
over
they
all
crowded
round
panting
asking
but
who
has
won
question
dodo
could
not
answer
without
great
deal
thought
sat
long
time
one
finger
pressed
upon
its
forehead
position
which
you
usually
see
shakespeare
pictures
him
while
rest
waited
silence
at
last
dodo
said
everybody
has
won
all
must
have
prizes
but
who
give
prizes
quite
chorus
voices
asked
why
she
course
said
dodo
pointing
alice
one
finger
whole
party
at
once
crowded
round
her
calling
out
confused
way
prizes
prizes
alice
had
no
idea
what
do
despair
she
put
her

pocket
pulled
out

luckily
salt

not
got
into
handed
them
round
prizes
there
exactly
one
apiece
all
round
but

dodo

very
gravely

got
your
pocket
he
went
turning
alice
only
thimble
said
alice
sadly
hand
over
here
said
dodo
then
they
all
crowded
round
her
once
more
while
dodo
solemnly
presented
thimble
saying
we
beg
your
acceptance
elegant
thimble
when
had
finished
short
speech
they
all
cheered
alice
thought
whole
thing
very
absurd
but
they
all
looked
so
grave
she
did
not
dare
laugh
she
could
not
think
anything
say
she
simply
bowed
took
thimble
looking
solemn
she
could
next
thing
eat
comfits
caused
some
noise
confusion
large
birds
complained
they
could
not
taste
theirs
small

choked

be
patted

over
at

alice
looking

at

she
kept

alice
always

its
head
impatiently
walked
little
quicker
what

lory
soon
quite
out

an
old
crab
took
opportunity
saying
her
daughter

remarkable
sensation
among

poor
alice
began

again
she
felt
very
lonely
lowspirited
little
while
however
she
again
heard
little
pattering
footsteps
distance
she
looked
up
eagerly
half
hoping
mouse
had
changed
his
mind
coming
back
finish
his
story
chapter

changed
since
her
swim
pool
great
hall
glass
table
little
door

vanished
completely
very
soon
rabbit

alice
she

angry
tone

said
she
came
upon
neat
little
house
door
which
bright
brass
plate
name
w
rabbit
engraved
upon
she
went
without
knocking
hurried
upstairs
great
fear
lest
she
should
meet
real
mary
ann
be
turned
out
house
before
she
had
found
fan
gloves
how
queer
seems
alice
said

she

fancying

thing

minute
nurse
but
ive

alice
went
theyd
let
dinah
stop
house
if
began
ordering
people
about
like
time
she
had
found
her
way
into
tidy
little
room
table
window
she
had
hoped
fan
two
or
three
pairs
tiny
white
kid
gloves
she
took
up
fan
pair
gloves
just
going
leave
room
when
her
eye
fell
upon
little
bottle
stood
near
looking
glass
there
no
label
time
words
drink
me
but
nevertheless
she
uncorked
put
her
lips
i
know
something
interesting
sure
happen
she
said
herself
whenever
i
eat
or
drink
anything
so
ill
just
see
what
bottle
does
i
do
hope
itll
make
me
grow
large
again
really
im
quite
tired
being
such
tiny
little
thing
did
so
indeed
much
sooner
than
she
had
expected
before
she
had
drunk
half
bottle
she
found
her
head
pressing
against
ceiling
had
stoop
save
her
neck
from
being
broken
she
hastily
put
down
bottle
saying
herself
thats
quite
enoughi
hope
i
shant
grow
any
moreas
i
cant
get
out
at
doori
do
wish
i
hadnt
drunk
quite
so
much
alas
too
late
wish
she
went
growing
growing
very
soon
had
kneel
down
floor
another
minute
there
not
even
room
she
tried
effect
lying
down
one
elbow
against
door
other
arm
curled
round
her
head
still
she
went
growing
last
resource
she
put
one
arm
out
window
one
foot
up
chimney
said
herself
now
i
can
do
no
more
whatever
happens
what
will
become
me
luckily
alice
little
magic
bottle
had
now
had
its
full
effect
she
grew
no
larger
still
very
uncomfortable
there
seemed
be
no
sort
chance
her
ever
getting
out
room
again
no
wonder
she
felt
unhappy
much
pleasanter
at
home
thought
poor
alice
when
one
wasnt
always
growing
larger
smaller
being
ordered
about
mice
rabbits
i
almost
wish
i
hadnt
gone
down
rabbitholeand
yetand
yetits
rather
curious
you

life
i
do
wonder
what

me
when
i
used
read
fairytales
i
fancied
kind
thing

happened
now
here
i
am
middle

there

be
book
written
about
me
there
ought
when
i
grow
up
ill
write
onebut
im
grown
up
now
she
added
sorrowful
tone
at
least
theres
no
room
grow
up
any
more
here
but
then
thought
alice
shall
i
never
get
any
older
than
i

now
thatll
be
comfort
one
waynever
be
an
old
woman
but

alice
she
answered
herself
how
can
you
learn
lessons
here
why
theres
hardly
room
you
no
room
at
all
any
lessonbooks
so
she
went
taking
first
one
side
then
other
making
quite
conversation
altogether
but
after
few
minutes
she
heard
voice
outside
stopped
listen
mary
ann
mary
ann
said
voice

my
gloves
moment
then
came
little
pattering
feet
stairs
alice
knew
rabbit
coming
look
her
she
trembled
till
she
shook
house
quite
forgetting
she
now
about
thousand
times
large
rabbit
had
no
reason
be
afraid
presently
rabbit
came
up
door
tried
open
but
door
opened
inwards
alices
elbow
pressed
hard
against
attempt
proved
failure
alice
heard
say
itself
then
ill

round

thought
alice
after
waiting
till
she
fancied
she
heard
rabbit
just
under
window
she
suddenly
spread
out
her
hand
made
snatch
air
she
did
not
get
hold
anything
but
she
heard
little
shriek
fall
crash
broken
glass
from
which
she
concluded
just
possible

fallen
into
cucumberframe
or
something
sort
next
came
an
angry
voicethe
rabbitspat
pat
where

at

she
spread

again
made
another
snatch
air
time
there
were
two
little
shrieks
more
sounds
broken

what

alice
i

she
drew
her
foot
far
down
chimney
she
could
waited
till
she
heard
little
animal
she
couldnt
guess
what
sort
scratching
scrambling
about
chimney
close
above
her
then
saying
herself
bill
she
gave
one
sharp
kick

she
heard
general

i

like

so
you

old
fellow
said
others
we
must
burn
house
down
said
rabbits
voice
alice
called
out
loud
she
could
if
you
do
ill
set
dinah
at
you
there
dead
silence
instantly
alice
thought
herself
i
wonder
what
they
will
do
next
if
they
had
any
sense
theyd
take
roof
off
after
minute
or
two
they
began
moving
about
again
alice
heard
rabbit
say
barrowful
will
do
begin
barrowful
what
thought
alice
but
she
had
not
long
doubt
next
moment
shower
little
pebbles
came
rattling
at
window
some
them
hit
her
face
ill
put
stop
she
said
herself
shouted
out
youd
better
not
do
again
which
produced
another
dead
silence
alice
noticed
some
surprise
pebbles
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
they
lay
floor
bright
idea
came
into
her
head
if
i
eat
one
these
cakes
she
thought
its
sure
make
some
change
my
size
cant
possibly
make
me
larger
must
make
me
smaller
i
suppose
so
she
swallowed
one
cakes
delighted
find
she
began
shrinking
directly
soon
she
small
enough
get
through
door
she
ran
out
house
found
quite
crowd
little
animals
birds
waiting
outside
poor
little
lizard
bill
middle
being
held
up
two
guineapigs
who
were
giving
something
out
bottle
they
all
made
rush
at
alice
moment
she
appeared
but
she
ran
off
hard
she
could
soon
found
herself
safe
thick
wood
first
thing
ive
got
do
said
alice
herself
she
wandered
about
wood
grow
my
right
size
again
second
thing
find
my
way
into
lovely
garden
i
think
will
be
best
plan
sounded
an
excellent
plan
no
doubt
very
neatly
simply
arranged
only
difficulty
she
had
not
smallest
idea
how
set
about
while
she
peering
about
anxiously
among
trees
little
sharp
bark
just
over
her
head
made
her
look
up
great
hurry
an
enormous
puppy
looking
down
at
her
large
round
eyes
feebly
stretching
out
one
paw
trying
touch
her
poor
little
thing
said
alice
coaxing
tone
she
tried
hard
whistle
but
she
terribly
frightened
all
time
at
thought
might
be
hungry
which
case
would
be
very
likely
eat
her
up
spite
all
her
coaxing
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
she
picked
up
little
bit
stick
held
out
puppy
whereupon
puppy
jumped
into
air
off
all
its
feet
at
once
yelp
delight
rushed
at
stick
made
believe
worry
then
alice
dodged
behind
great
thistle
keep
herself
from
being
run
over
moment
she
appeared
other
side
puppy
made
another
rush
at
stick
tumbled
head
over
heels
its
hurry
get
hold
then
alice
thinking
very
like
having
game
play
carthorse
expecting
every
moment
be
trampled
under
its
feet
ran
round
thistle
again
then
puppy
began
series
short
charges
at
stick
running
very
little
way
forwards
each
time
long
way
back
barking
hoarsely
all
while
till
at
last
sat
down
good
way
off
panting
its
tongue
hanging
out
its
mouth
its
great
eyes
half
shut
seemed
alice
good
opportunity
making
her
escape
so
she
set
off
at
once
ran
till
she
quite
tired
out
breath
till
puppys
bark
sounded
quite
faint
distance
yet
what
dear
little
puppy
said
alice
she
leant
against
buttercup
rest
herself
fanned
herself
one
leaves
i
should
have
liked
teaching
tricks
very
much
ifif
id
only
been
right
size
do
oh
dear
id
nearly
forgotten
ive
got
grow
up
again
let
me
seehow
be
managed
i
suppose
i
ought
eat
or
drink
something
or
other
but
great
question
what
great
question
certainly
what
alice
looked
all
round
her
at
flowers
blades
grass
but
she
did
not
see
anything
looked
like
right
thing
eat
or
drink
under
circumstances
there
large
mushroom
growing
near
her
about
same
height
herself
when
she
had
looked
under
both
sides
behind
occurred
her
she
might
well
look
see
what
top
she
stretched
herself
up
tiptoe
peeped
over
edge
mushroom
her
eyes
immediately
met
those
large
caterpillar
sitting
top
its
arms
folded
quietly
smoking
long
hookah
taking
not
smallest
notice
her
or
anything
else
chapter
v
advice
from
caterpillar
caterpillar
alice
looked
at
each
other
some
time
silence
at
last
caterpillar
took
hookah
out
its
mouth
addressed
her
languid
sleepy
voice
who
are
you
said
caterpillar
not
an
encouraging
opening
conversation
alice
replied
rather
shyly
ii
hardly
know
sir
just
at
present
at
least
i
know
who
i
when
i
got
up
morning
but
i
think
i
must
have
been
changed
several
times
since
then
what
do
you
mean
said
caterpillar
sternly
explain
yourself
i
cant
explain
myself
im
afraid
sir
said
alice
because
im
not
myself
you
see
i
dont
see
said
caterpillar
im
afraid
i
cant
put
more
clearly
alice
replied
very
politely
i
cant
understand
myself
begin
being
so
many
different
sizes
day
very
confusing
isnt
said
caterpillar
well
perhaps
you
havent
found
so
yet
said
alice
but
when
you
have
turn
into
chrysalisyou
will
some
day
you
knowand
then
after
into
butterfly
i
should
think
youll
feel
little
queer
wont
you
not
bit
said
caterpillar
well
perhaps
your
feelings
may
be
different
said
alice
all
i
know
would
feel
very
queer
me
you
said
caterpillar
contemptuously
who
are
you
which
brought
them
back
again
beginning
conversation
alice
felt
little
irritated
at
caterpillars
making
such
very
short
remarks
she
drew
herself
up
said
very
gravely
i
think
you
ought
tell
me
who
you
are
first
why
said
caterpillar
here
another
puzzling
question
alice
could
not
think
any
good
reason
caterpillar
seemed
be
very
unpleasant
state
mind
she
turned
away
come
back
caterpillar
called
after
her
ive
something
important
say
sounded
promising
certainly
alice
turned
came
back
again
keep
your
temper
said
caterpillar
all
said
alice
swallowing
down
her
anger
well
she
could
no
said
caterpillar
alice
thought
she
might
well
wait
she
had
nothing
else
do
perhaps
after
all
might
tell
her
something
worth
hearing
some
minutes
puffed
away
without
speaking
but
at
last
unfolded
its
arms
took
hookah
out
its
mouth
again
said
so
you
think
youre
changed
do
you
im
afraid
i
am
sir
said
alice
i
cant
remember
things
i
usedand
i
dont
keep
same
size
ten
minutes
together
cant
remember
what
things
said
caterpillar
well
ive
tried

how
doth
little
busy
bee
but
all
came
different
alice
replied
very
melancholy
voice
repeat

william
said
caterpillar
alice
folded
her
hands
began
you

old
father
william
young
man

become
very
white
yet

incessantly

head

your
age

my
youth
father
william
replied
his
son

youth

yet
you
finished
goose
bones
beak
pray
how
did
you
manage
do
my
youth
said
his
father
i
took
law

each
case
my
wife
muscular
strength
which
gave
my
jaw
has
lasted
rest
my
life
you

old
said
youth
one
would
hardly
suppose
your
eye
steady
ever
yet
you
balanced
an
eel
end
your
nose
what
made
you
so
awfully
clever
i

questions
enough

his
father

stuff

or
ill

said
caterpillar
not
quite
right
im
afraid
said
alice
timidly
some
words
have
got
altered
wrong
from
beginning
end
said
caterpillar
decidedly
there
silence
some
minutes
caterpillar
first
speak
what
size
do
you
want
be
asked
oh
im
not
particular
size
alice
hastily
replied
only
one
doesnt
like
changing
so
often
you
know
i
dont
know
said
caterpillar
alice
said
nothing
she
had
never
been
so
much
contradicted
her
life
before
she
felt
she
losing
her
temper
are
you
content
now
said
caterpillar
well
i
should
like
be
little
larger
sir
if
you
wouldnt
mind
said
alice
three
inches
such
wretched
height
be
very
good
height
indeed
said
caterpillar
angrily
rearing
itself
upright
spoke
exactly
three
inches
high
but
im
not
used
pleaded
poor
alice
piteous
tone
she
thought
herself
i
wish
creatures
wouldnt
be
so
easily
offended
youll
get
used
time
said
caterpillar
put
hookah
into
its
mouth
began
smoking
again
time
alice
waited
patiently
until
chose
speak
again
minute
or
two
caterpillar
took
hookah
out
its
mouth
yawned
once
or
twice
shook
itself
then
got
down
off
mushroom
crawled
away
grass
merely
remarking
went
one
side
will
make
you
grow
taller
other
side
will
make
you
grow
shorter
one
side
what
other
side
what
thought
alice
herself
mushroom
said
caterpillar
just
if
she
had
asked
aloud
another
moment
out
sight
alice
remained
looking
thoughtfully
at
mushroom
minute
trying
make
out
which
were
two
sides
perfectly
round
she
found
very
difficult
question
however
at
last
she
stretched
her
arms
round
far
they
would
go
broke
off
bit
edge
each
hand
now
which
which
she
said
herself
nibbled
little
righthand
bit
try
effect
next
moment
she
felt
violent
blow
underneath
her
chin
had
struck
her
foot
she
good
deal
frightened
very
sudden
change
but
she
felt
there
no
time
be
lost
she
shrinking
rapidly
so
she
set
work
at
once
eat
some
other
bit
her
chin
pressed
so
closely
against
her
foot
there
hardly
room
open
her
mouth
but
she
did
at
last
managed
swallow
morsel
lefthand
bit
come
my
heads
free
at
last
said
alice
tone
delight
which
changed
into
alarm
another
moment
when
she
found
her
shoulders
were
nowhere
be
found
all
she
could
see
when
she
looked
down
an
immense
length
neck
which
seemed
rise
like
stalk
out
sea
green
leaves
lay
far
below
her
what
can
all
green
stuff
be
said
alice
where
have
my
shoulders
got
oh
my
poor
hands
how
i
cant
see
you
she
moving
them
about
she
spoke
but
no
result
seemed
follow
except
little
shaking
among
distant
green
leaves
there
seemed
be
no
chance
getting
her
hands
up
her
head
she
tried
get
her
head
down
them
delighted
find
her
neck
would
bend
about
easily
any
direction
like
serpent
she
had
just
succeeded
curving
down
into
graceful
zigzag
going
dive
among
leaves
which
she
found
be
nothing
but
tops
trees
under
which
she
had
been
wandering
when
sharp
hiss
made
her
draw
back
hurry
large
pigeon
had
flown
into
her
face
beating
her
violently
its
wings
serpent
screamed
pigeon
im
not
serpent
said
alice
indignantly
let
me
alone
serpent
i
say
again
repeated
pigeon
but
more
subdued
tone
added
kind
sob
ive
tried
every
way
nothing
seems
suit
them
i
havent
least
idea
what
youre
talking
about
said
alice
ive
tried
roots
trees
ive
tried
banks
ive
tried
hedges
pigeon
went
without
attending
her
but
those
serpents
theres
no
pleasing
them
alice
more
more
puzzled
but
she
thought
there
no
use
saying
anything
more
till
pigeon
had
finished
if
wasnt
trouble
enough
hatching
eggs
said
pigeon
but
i
must
be
lookout
serpents
night
day
why
i
havent
had
wink
sleep
these
three
weeks
im
very
sorry
youve
been
annoyed
said
alice
who
beginning
see
its
meaning
just
id
taken
highest
tree
wood
continued
pigeon
raising
its
voice
shriek
just
i
thinking
i
should
be
free
them
at
last
they
must
needs
come
wriggling
down
from
sky
ugh
serpent
but
im
not
serpent
i
tell
you
said
alice
im
aim
well
what
are
you
said
pigeon
i
can
see
youre
trying
invent
something
iim
little
girl
said
alice
rather
doubtfully
she
remembered
number
changes
she
had
gone
through
day
likely
story
indeed
said
pigeon
tone
deepest
contempt
ive
seen
good
many
little
girls
my
time
but
never
one
such
neck
no
no
youre
serpent
theres
no
use
denying
i
suppose
youll
be
telling
me
next
you
never
tasted
an
egg
i
have
tasted
eggs
certainly
said
alice
who
very
truthful
child
but
little
girls
eat
eggs
quite
much
serpents
do
you
know
i
dont
believe
said
pigeon
but
if
they
do
why
then
theyre
kind
serpent
thats
all
i
can
say
such
new
idea
alice
she
quite
silent
minute
or
two
which
gave
pigeon
opportunity
adding
youre
looking
eggs
i
know
well
enough
what
does
matter
me
whether
youre
little
girl
or
serpent
matters
good
deal
me
said
alice
hastily
but
im
not
looking
eggs
happens
if
i
i
shouldnt
want
yours
i
dont
like
them
raw
well
be
off
then
said
pigeon
sulky
tone
settled
down
again
into
its
nest
alice
crouched
down
among
trees
well
she
could
her
neck
kept
getting
entangled
among
branches
every
now
then
she
had
stop
untwist
after
while
she
remembered
she
still
held
pieces
mushroom
her
hands
she
set
work
very
carefully
nibbling
first
at
one
then
at
other
growing
sometimes
taller
sometimes
shorter
until
she
had
succeeded
bringing
herself
down
her
usual
height
so
long
since
she
had
been
anything
near
right
size
felt
quite
strange
at
first
but
she
got
used
few
minutes
began
talking
herself
usual
come
theres
half
my
plan
done
now
how
puzzling
all
these
changes
are
im
never
sure
what
im
going
be
from
one
minute
another
however
ive
got
back
my
right
size
next
thing
get
into
beautiful
gardenhow
be
done
i
wonder
she
said
she
came
suddenly
upon
an
open
place
little
house
about
four
feet
high
whoever
lives
there
thought
alice
itll
never
do
come
upon
them
size
why
i
should
frighten
them
out
their
wits
so
she
began
nibbling
at
righthand
bit
again
did
not
venture
go
near
house
till
she
had
brought
herself
down
nine
inches
high
chapter
vi
pig
pepper
minute
or
two
she
stood
looking
at
house
wondering
what
do
next
when
suddenly
footman
livery
came
running
out
woodshe
considered
him
be
footman
because
he
livery
otherwise
judging
his
face
only
she
would
have
called
him
fishand
rapped
loudly
at
door
his
knuckles
opened
another
footman
livery
round
face
large
eyes
like
frog
both
footmen
alice
noticed
had
powdered
hair
curled
all
over
their
heads
she
felt
very
curious
know
what
all
about
crept
little
way
out
wood
listen
fishfootman
began
producing
from
under
his
arm
great
letter
nearly
large
himself
he
handed
over
other
saying
solemn
tone
duchess
an
invitation
from
queen
play
croquet
frogfootman
repeated
same
solemn
tone
only
changing
order
words
little
from
queen
an
invitation
duchess
play
croquet
then
they
both
bowed
low
their
curls
got
entangled
together
alice
laughed
so
much
at
she
had
run
back
into
wood
fear
their
hearing
her
when
she
next
peeped
out
fishfootman
gone
other
sitting
ground
near
door
staring
stupidly
up
into
sky
alice
went
timidly
up
door
knocked
theres
no
sort
use
knocking
said
footman
two
reasons
first
because
im
same
side
door
you
are
secondly
because
theyre
making
such
noise
inside
no
one
could
possibly
hear
you
certainly
there
most
extraordinary
noise
going
withina
constant
howling
sneezing
every
now
then
great
crash
if
dish
or
kettle
had
been
broken
pieces
please
then
said
alice
how
am
i
get
there
might
be
some
sense
your
knocking
footman
went
without
attending
her
if
we
had
door
between
us
instance
if
you
were
inside
you
might
knock
i
could
let
you
out
you
know
he
looking
up
into
sky
all
time
he
speaking
alice
thought
decidedly
uncivil
but
perhaps
he
cant
help
she
said
herself
his
eyes
are
so
very
nearly
at
top
his
head
but
at
any
rate
he
might
answer
questionshow
am
i
get
she
repeated
aloud
i
shall
sit
here
footman
remarked
till
tomorrow
at
moment
door
house
opened
large
plate
came
skimming
out
straight
at
footmans
head
just
grazed
his
nose
broke
pieces
against
one
trees
behind
him
or
next
day
maybe
footman
continued
same
tone
exactly
if
nothing
had
happened
how
am
i
get
asked
alice
again
louder
tone
are
you
get
at
all
said
footman
thats
first
question
you
know
no
doubt
only
alice
did
not
like
be
told
so
its
really
dreadful
she
muttered
herself
way
all
creatures
argue
its
enough
drive
one
crazy
footman
seemed
think
good
opportunity
repeating
his
remark
variations
i
shall
sit
here
he
said
off
days
days
but
what
am
i
do
said
alice
anything
you
like
said
footman
began
whistling
oh
theres
no
use
talking
him
said
alice
desperately
hes
perfectly
idiotic
she
opened
door
went
door
led
right
into
large
kitchen
which
full
smoke
from
one
end
other
duchess
sitting
threelegged
stool
middle
nursing
baby
cook
leaning
over
fire
stirring
large
cauldron
which
seemed
be
full
soup
theres
certainly
too
much
pepper
soup
alice
said
herself
well
she
could
sneezing
there
certainly
too
much
air
even
duchess
sneezed
occasionally
baby
sneezing
howling
alternately
without
moments
pause
only
things
kitchen
did
not
sneeze
were
cook
large
cat
which
sitting
hearth
grinning
from
ear
ear
please
would
you
tell
me
said
alice
little
timidly
she
not
quite
sure
whether
good
manners
her
speak
first
why
your
cat
grins
like
its
cheshire
cat
said
duchess
thats
why
pig
she
said
last
word
such
sudden
violence
alice
quite
jumped
but
she
saw
another
moment
addressed
baby
not
her
so
she
took
courage
went
again
i
didnt
know
cheshire
cats
always
grinned
fact
i
didnt
know
cats
could
grin
they
all
can
said
duchess
most
em
do
i
dont
know
any
do
alice
said
very
politely
feeling
quite
pleased
have
got
into
conversation
you
dont
know
much
said
duchess
thats
fact
alice
did
not
at
all
like
tone
remark
thought
would
be
well
introduce
some
other
subject
conversation
while
she
trying
fix
one
cook
took
cauldron
soup
off
fire
at
once
set
work
throwing
everything
within
her
reach
at
duchess
baby
fireirons
came
first
then
followed
shower
saucepans
plates
dishes
duchess
took
no
notice
them
even
when
they
hit
her
baby
howling
so
much
already
quite
impossible
say
whether
blows
hurt
or
not
oh
please
mind
what
youre
doing
cried
alice
jumping
up
down
an
agony
terror
oh
there
goes
his
precious
nose
an
unusually
large
saucepan
flew
close
very
nearly
carried
off
if
everybody
minded
their
own
business
duchess
said
hoarse
growl
world
would
go
round
deal
faster
than
does
which
would
not
be
an
advantage
said
alice
who
felt
very
glad
get
an
opportunity
showing
off
little
her
knowledge
just
think
what
work
would
make
day
night
you
see
earth
takes
twentyfour
hours
turn
round
its
axis
talking
axes
said
duchess
chop
off
her
head
alice
glanced
rather
anxiously
at
cook
see
if
she
meant
take
hint
but
cook
busily
stirring
soup
seemed
not
be
listening
so
she
went
again
twentyfour
hours
i
think
or
twelve
i
oh
dont
bother
me
said
duchess
i
never
could
abide
figures
she
began
nursing
her
child
again
singing
sort
lullaby
she
did
so
giving
violent
shake
at
end
every
line
speak
roughly
your
little
boy
beat
him
when
he
sneezes
he
only
does
annoy
because
he
knows
teases
chorus
which
cook
baby
joined
wow
wow
wow
while
duchess
sang
second
verse
song
she
kept
tossing
baby
violently
up
down
poor
little
thing
howled
so
alice
could
hardly
hear
words
i
speak
severely
my
boy
i
beat
him
when
he
sneezes
he
can
thoroughly
enjoy
pepper
when
he
pleases
chorus
wow
wow
wow
here
you
may
nurse
bit
if
you
like
duchess
said
alice
flinging
baby
at
her
she
spoke
i
must
go
get
ready
play
croquet
queen
she
hurried
out
room
cook
threw
fryingpan
after
her
she
went
out
but
just
missed
her
alice
caught
baby
some
difficulty
queer
shaped
little
creature
held
out
its
arms
legs
all
directions
just
like
starfish
thought
alice
poor
little
thing
snorting
like
steamengine
when
she
caught
kept
doubling
itself
up
straightening
itself
out
again
so
altogether
first
minute
or
two
much
she
could
do
hold
soon
she
had
made
out
proper
way
nursing
which
twist
up
into
sort
knot
then
keep
tight
hold
its
right
ear
left
foot
so
prevent
its
undoing
itself
she
carried
out
into
open
air
if
i
dont
take
child
away
me
thought
alice
theyre
sure
kill
day
or
two
wouldnt
be
murder
leave
behind
she
said
last
words
out
loud
little
thing
grunted
reply
had
left
off
sneezing
time
dont
grunt
said
alice
thats
not
at
all
proper
way
expressing
yourself
baby
grunted
again
alice
looked
very
anxiously
into
its
face
see
what
matter
there
could
be
no
doubt
had
very
turnup
nose
much
more
like
snout
than
real
nose
also
its
eyes
were
getting
extremely
small
baby
altogether
alice
did
not
like
look
thing
at
all
but
perhaps
only
sobbing
she
thought
looked
into
its
eyes
again
see
if
there
were
any
tears
no
there
were
no
tears
if
youre
going
turn
into
pig
my
dear
said
alice
seriously
ill
have
nothing
more
do
you
mind
now
poor
little
thing
sobbed
again
or
grunted
impossible
say
which
they
went
some
while
silence
alice
just
beginning
think
herself
now
what
am
i
do
creature
when
i
get
home
when
grunted
again
so
violently
she
looked
down
into
its
face
some
alarm
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
neither
more
nor
less
than
pig
she
felt
would
be
quite
absurd
her
carry
further
so
she
set
little
creature
down
felt
quite
relieved
see
trot
away
quietly
into
wood
if
had
grown
up
she
said
herself
would
have
made
dreadfully
ugly
child
but
makes
rather
handsome
pig
i
think
she
began
thinking
over
other
children
she
knew
who
might
do
very
well
pigs
just
saying
herself
if
one
only
knew
right
way
change
them
when
she
little
startled
seeing
cheshire
cat
sitting
bough
tree
few
yards
off
cat
only
grinned
when
saw
alice
looked
good
natured
she
thought
still
had
very
long
claws
great
many
teeth
so
she
felt
ought
be
treated
respect
cheshire
puss
she
began
rather
timidly
she
did
not
at
all
know
whether
would
like
name
however
only
grinned
little
wider
come
its
pleased
so
far
thought
alice
she
went
would
you
tell
me
please
which
way
i
ought
go
from
here
depends
good
deal
where
you
want
get
said
cat
i
dont
much
care
where
said
alice
then
doesnt
matter
which
way
you
go
said
cat
so
long
i
get
somewhere
alice
added
an
explanation
oh
youre
sure
do
said
cat
if
you
only
walk
long
enough
alice
felt
could
not
be
denied
so
she
tried
another
question
what
sort
people
live
about
here
direction
cat
said
waving
its
right
paw
round
lives
hatter
direction
waving
other
paw
lives
march

theyre
both
mad
but

alice
remarked

said
cat

said
alice

alice
didnt

proved
at
all
however
she
went
how
do
you
know
youre
mad
begin
said
cat
dogs

said
alice
well
then
cat
went
you
see
dog
growls
when
its
angry
wags
its
tail
when
its
pleased
now
i
growl
when
im
pleased

alice

said
alice
but

invited
yet
youll

said
cat
vanished
alice
not
much
surprised
at
she
getting
so
used
queer
things
happening
while
she
looking
at
place
where
had
been
suddenly
appeared
again
bythebye
what
became
baby
said
cat
id
nearly
forgotten
ask

into
pig
alice
quietly
said
just
if

back
natural
way
i
thought
would
said
cat
vanished
again
alice
waited
little
half
expecting
see

but
did
not
appear
after
minute
or
two
she
walked
direction
which
march
hare
said
live
ive
seen
hatters
before
she
said
herself
march
hare
will
be
much
most
interesting
perhaps

wont
be
raving
madat
least
not
so
mad
march
she
said
she
looked
up
there
cat
again
sitting
branch
tree
did
you
say
pig
or
fig
said
cat
i
said
pig
replied
alice
i
wish
you
wouldnt
keep
appearing
vanishing
so
suddenly
you
make
one
quite
giddy
all
right
said
cat
time
vanished
quite
slowly
beginning
end
tail
ending
grin
which
remained
some
time
after
rest
had
gone
well
ive
often
seen
cat
without
grin
thought
alice
but
grin
without
cat
its
most
curious
thing
i
ever
say
my
life
she
had
not
gone
much
farther
before
she
came
sight
house
march
hare
she
thought
must
be
right
house
because
chimneys
were
shaped
like
ears
roof
thatched
fur
so
large
house
she
did
not
like
go
nearer
till
she
had
nibbled
some
more
lefthand
bit
mushroom
raised
herself
about
two
feet
high
even
then
she
walked
up
towards
rather
timidly
saying
herself
suppose
should
be
raving
mad
after
all
i
almost
wish
id
gone
see
hatter
instead

an
encouraging
tone
alice
looked

hatter
he
had
been

alice
some
time
great
curiosity
his
first
speech
you

personal
remarks
alice
said
some
severity
its
very
rude
hatter
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
hearing
but
all
he
said
why
raven

alice

she
added
aloud
do

thing
i

said
hatter
here
conversation
dropped
party
sat
silent
minute
while
alice
thought
over
all
she
could
remember
about
ravens
writingdesks
which
wasnt
much
hatter
first
break
silence
what
day
month
he
said
turning
alice
he
had
taken
his
watch
out
his
pocket
looking
at
uneasily
shaking
every
now
then
holding
his
ear
alice
considered
little
then
said
fourth
two
days
wrong
sighed
hatter
i
told
you
butter
wouldnt
suit

he
added
looking
angrily
at
march
hare
best
butter
march
hare
meekly
replied
yes
but
some
crumbs
must
have
got
well
hatter
grumbled
you
shouldnt
have
put
breadknife
march
hare
took
watch
looked
at
gloomily
then
he
dipped
into
his
cup
tea
looked
at
again
but
he
could
think
nothing
better
say
than
his
first
remark
best
butter
you
know
alice
had
been
looking
over
his
shoulder
some
curiosity
what
funny
watch
she
remarked
tells
day
month
doesnt
tell
what
oclock
why
should
muttered
hatter
does
your
watch
tell
you
what
year
course
not
alice
replied
very
readily
but
thats
because

same
year
such
long
time
together
which
just
case
mine
said
hatter
alice
felt
dreadfully
puzzled
hatters
remark
seemed
have
no
sort
meaning
yet
certainly
english
i
dont
quite
understand
you
she
said
politely
she
could
dormouse
asleep
again
said
hatter
he
poured
little
hot
tea
upon
its
nose
dormouse
shook
its
head
impatiently
said
without
opening
its
eyes

course
just
what
i
going
remark
myself

alice
again

alice
replied

slightest
idea

hatter
nor
i
said
march

alice
sighed
wearily
i
think
you

do
something
better
time
she
said
than

asking
riddles

no
answers
if
you
knew
time

i

hatter
you

talk
about

alice

said
tossing
his
head
contemptuously
i
dare
say

cautiously
replied
but
i

roared
queen
alice
joined
procession
wondering
very
much
what
would
happen
next
itsits
very
fine
day
said
timid
voice
at
her
side
she
walking
white
rabbit
who
peeping
anxiously
into
her
face
very
said
alice
wheres
duchess
hush
hush
said
rabbit
low
hurried
tone
he
looked
anxiously
over
his
shoulder
he
spoke
then
raised
himself
upon
tiptoe
put
his
mouth
close
her
ear
whispered
shes
under
sentence
execution
what
said
alice
did
you

alice
gave
little
scream
laughter

frightened
tone
queen

she
came
rather
late
queen
said

places
shouted
queen
voice
thunder
people
began
running
about
all
directions
tumbling
up
against
each
other
however
they
got
settled
down
minute
or
two
game
began
alice
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
curious
croquetground
her
life
all
ridges
furrows
balls
were
live
hedgehogs
mallets
live
flamingoes
soldiers
had
double
themselves
up
stand
their
hands
feet
make
arches
chief
difficulty
alice
found
at
first
managing
her
flamingo
she
succeeded
getting
its
body
tucked
away
comfortably
enough
under
her
arm
its
legs
hanging
down
but
generally
just
she
had
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
out
going
give
hedgehog
blow
its
head
would
twist
itself
round
look
up
her
face
such
puzzled
expression
she
could
not
help
bursting
out
laughing
when
she
had
got
its
head
down
going
begin
again
very
provoking
find
hedgehog
had
unrolled
itself
act
crawling
away
besides
all
there
generally
ridge
or
furrow
way
wherever
she
wanted
send
hedgehog
doubledup
soldiers
were
always
getting
up
walking
off
other
parts
ground
alice
soon
came
conclusion
very
difficult
game
indeed
players
all
played
at
once
without
waiting
turns
quarrelling
all
while
fighting
hedgehogs
very
short
time
queen
furious
passion
went
stamping
about
shouting
off
his
head
or
off
her
head
about
once
minute
alice
began
feel
very
uneasy
be
sure
she
had
not
yet
had
any
dispute
queen
but
she
knew
might
happen
any
minute
then
thought
she
what
would
become
me
theyre
dreadfully
fond
beheading
people
here
great
wonder
theres
any
one
left
alive
she
looking
about
some
way
escape
wondering
whether
she
could
get
away
without
being
seen
when
she
noticed
curious
appearance
air
puzzled
her
very
much
at
first
but
after
watching
minute
or
two
she
made
out
be
grin
she
said
herself
its
cheshire
cat
now
i
shall
have
somebody
talk
how
are
you
getting
said
cat
soon
there
mouth
enough
speak
alice
waited
till
eyes
appeared
then
nodded
its
no
use
speaking
she
thought
till
its
ears
have
come
or
at
least
one
them
another
minute
whole
head
appeared
then
alice
put
down
her
flamingo
began
an
account
game
feeling
very
glad
she
had
someone
listen
her
cat
seemed
think
there
enough
now
sight
no
more
appeared
i
dont
think
they
play
at
all
fairly
alice
began
rather
complaining
tone
they
all
quarrel
so
dreadfully
one
cant
hear
oneself
speakand
they
dont
seem
have
any
rules
particular
at
least
if
there
are
nobody
attends
themand
youve
no
idea
how
confusing
all
things
being
alive
instance
theres
arch
ive
got
go
through
next
walking
about
at
other
end
groundand
i
should
have
croqueted
queens
hedgehog
just
now
only
ran
away
when
saw
mine
coming
how
do
you
like
queen
said
cat
low
voice
not
at
all
said
alice
shes
so
extremely
just
then
she
noticed
queen
close
behind
her
listening
so
she
went
likely
win
its
hardly
worth
while
finishing
game
queen
smiled
passed
who
are
you
talking
said
king
going
up
alice
looking
at
cats
head
great
curiosity
its
friend
minea
cheshire
cat
said
alice
allow
me
introduce
i
dont
like
look
at
all
said
king
however
may
kiss
my
hand
if
likes
id
rather
not
cat
remarked
dont
be
impertinent
said
king
dont
look
at
me
like
he
got
behind
alice
he
spoke
cat
may
look
at
king
said
alice
ive
read
some
book
but
i
dont
remember
where
well

be
removed
said
king
very
decidedly
he
called
queen
who
passing
at
moment
my
dear
i
wish
you
would
have
cat
removed
queen
had
only
one
way
settling
all
difficulties
great
or
small
off
his
head
she
said
without
even
looking
round
ill
fetch
executioner
myself
said
king
eagerly
he
hurried
off
alice
thought
she
might
well
go
back
see
how
game
going
she
heard
queens
voice
distance
screaming
passion
she
had
already
heard
her
sentence
three
players
be
executed
having
missed
their
turns
she
did
not
like
look
things
at
all
game
such
confusion
she
never
knew
whether
her
turn
or
not
so
she
went
search
her
hedgehog
hedgehog
engaged
fight
another
hedgehog
which
seemed
alice
an
excellent
opportunity
croqueting
one
them
other
only
difficulty
her
flamingo
gone
across
other
side
garden
where
alice
could
see
trying
helpless
sort
way
fly
up
into
tree
time
she
had
caught
flamingo
brought
back
fight
over
both
hedgehogs
were
out
sight
but
doesnt
matter
much
thought
alice
all
arches
are
gone
from
side
ground
so
she
tucked
away
under
her
arm
might
not
escape
again
went
back
little
more
conversation
her
friend
when
she
got
back
cheshire
cat
she
surprised
find
quite
large
crowd
collected
round
there
dispute
going
between
executioner
king
queen
who
were
all
talking
at
once
while
all
rest
were
quite
silent
looked
very
uncomfortable
moment
alice
appeared
she
appealed
all
three
settle
question
they
repeated
their
arguments
her
though
they
all
spoke
at
once
she
found
very
hard
indeed
make
out
exactly
what
they
said
executioners
argument
you
couldnt
cut
off
head
unless
there
body
cut
off
from
he
had
never
had
do
such
thing
before
he
wasnt
going

at
his
time

be
beheaded
you
werent
talk
nonsense
queens
argument
if
something
wasnt
done
about
less
than
no
time
shed
have
everybody
executed
all
round
last
remark
had
made
whole
party
look
so
grave
anxious
alice
could
think
nothing
else
say
but
belongs
duchess
youd
better
ask
her
about
shes
prison
queen
said
executioner
fetch
her
here
executioner
went
off
like
an
arrow
cats
head
began
fading
away
moment
he
gone
time
he
had
come
back
dutchess
had
entirely
disappeared
so
king
executioner
ran
wildly
up
down
looking

alice

squeezed

up
closer
alices
side
she

alice

not
much
like
keeping

close
her
first
because
duchess
very
ugly
secondly
because

rest
her
chin
upon
alices
shoulder
an
uncomfortably
sharp
chin
however
she
did
not

politely

i
cant
quite

about

duchesss
voice

her
favourite

moral
arm
linked
into
hers
began
tremble
alice
looked
up
there
stood
queen

them
her
arms
folded
frowning
like
thunderstorm
fine
day
your
majesty
duchess
began
low
weak
voice
now
i
give

fair
warning
shouted
queen
stamping
ground
she
spoke

duchess
took

resting

however
moment
they
saw
her
they
hurried
back

queen
merely
remarking
moments
delay
would
cost
them
their
lives
all
time
they
were
playing
queen
never
left
off
quarrelling
other
players
shouting
off
his
head
or
off
her
head
those
whom
she
sentenced

taken
into
custody
soldiers
who

half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
no
arches
left

then
queen
left
off
quite
out

said
alice

alice
i
dont

they

off
together
alice
heard
king
say
low
voice

generally

she
said
herself
she
had
felt
quite
unhappy
at
number
executions
queen
had
ordered
they
very
soon
came
upon
gryphon
lying
fast
asleep
sun
if

leaving
alice
alone
gryphon
alice
did
not
quite
like
look
creature
but
whole
she
thought
would
be
quite
safe
stay
go
after
savage
queen
so
she
waited
gryphon
sat
up
rubbed
its
eyes
then
watched
queen
till
she
out
sight
then
chuckled
what
fun
said
gryphon
half
itself
half
alice
what
fun

alice
why
she
said
gryphon
its
all
her
fancy
they
never
executes
nobody
you

come
everybody

thought
alice
she
went
slowly
after
i
never
so
ordered
about
all
my
life
never
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
saw
mock
turtle
distance
sitting
sad
lonely
little
ledge
rock
they
came
nearer
alice
could
hear
him
sighing
if
his
heart
would
break
she
pitied
him
deeply
what
his
sorrow
she
asked
gryphon
gryphon
answered
very
nearly
same
words
before
its
all
his
fancy
he
hasnt
got
no
sorrow
you
know
come
so
they
went
up
mock
turtle
who
looked
at
them
large
eyes
full
tears
but
said
nothing
here
young
lady
said
gryphon
she
wants
know
your
history
she
do
ill
tell
her
said
mock
turtle
deep
hollow
tone
sit
down
both
you
dont
speak
word
till
ive
finished
so
they
sat
down
nobody
spoke
some
minutes
alice
thought
herself
i
dont
see
how
he
can
even
finish
if
he
doesnt
begin
but
she
waited
patiently
once
said
mock
turtle
at
last
deep
sigh
i
real
turtle
these
words
were
followed
very
long
silence
broken
only
an
occasional
exclamation
hjckrrh
from
gryphon
constant
heavy
sobbing
mock
turtle
alice
very
nearly
getting
up
saying
thank
you
sir
your
interesting
story
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
there
must
be
more
come
so
she
sat
still
said
nothing
when
we
were
little
mock
turtle
went
at
last
more
calmly
though
still
sobbing
little
now
then
we
went
school
sea
master
an
old
turtlewe
used
call
him
tortoise
why
did
you
call
him
tortoise
if
he
wasnt

alice
asked
we
called
him
tortoise
because
he
taught
us
said
mock
turtle
angrily
really
you
are
very
dull
you
ought
be
ashamed
yourself
asking
such
simple
question
added
gryphon
then
they
both
sat
silent
looked
at
poor
alice
who
felt
ready
sink
into
earth
at
last
gryphon
said
mock
turtle
drive

minute
or
two
sobs
choked
his
voice

if

gryphon
set

shaking
him
punching
him
back
at

mock

his
voice
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
he
went

alice
whose

tone
gryphon
added

mock
turtle
no
no

first
said
gryphon
an
impatient
tone
explanations
take
such
dreadful
time
so
alice
began
telling
them
her
adventures
from
time
when
she
first
saw
white
rabbit
she
little
nervous
about
just
at
first
two
creatures
got
so
close
her
one
each
side
opened
their
eyes
mouths
so
very
wide
but
she
gained
courage
she
went
her
listeners
were
perfectly
quiet
till
she
got
part
about
her
repeating
you
are
old
father
william
caterpillar
words
all
coming
different
then
mock

drew
long
breath

mock

repeated
thoughtfully

he
looked
at
gryphon
if
he
thought

authority
over
alice
stand
up

tis
voice
sluggard
said
gryphon
how

however
she
got

but
her
head
so
full
lobster
quadrille
she
hardly

look

wish
theyd
get

done
she
thought
hand
round
refreshments
but
there
seemed
be
no
chance
so
she
began
looking
at
everything
about
her
pass
away
time
alice
had
never
been
court
justice
before
but
she
had
read
about
them
books
she
quite
pleased
find
she
knew

nearly
everything
there
thats

she
said
herself
because
his
great

he
wore
his

over

look
at

if
you
want
see
how
he

look
at
all
comfortable
certainly
not
becoming
thats
jurybox
thought
alice
those
twelve
creatures
she
obliged
say
creatures
you
see
because
some
them
were
animals
some
were
birds
i
suppose
they
are
jurors
she
said
last
word
two
or
three
times
over
herself
being
rather
proud
she
thought
rightly
too
very
few
little
girls
her
age
knew
meaning
at
all
however
jurymen
would
have
done
just
well
twelve
jurors
were
all
writing
very
busily
slates
what

they
doing
alice
whispered
gryphon
they
cant
have
anything
put
down

before

theyre
putting

gryphon
whispered

fear
they
should
forget
them
before

loud
indignant
voice
but
she
stopped
hastily
white

cried
out

put
his
spectacles
looked
anxiously
round
make
out
who

alice
could
see
well
if
she
were
looking
over
their
shoulders
all
jurors
were
writing
down
stupid
things
their
slates
she
could
even
make
out

didnt

stupid
he
had
ask
his

alice

did
so
quickly
poor

just
at

very
curious
sensation
which
puzzled
her
good
deal
until
she
made
out
what
she
beginning
grow
larger
again

alice
quite
forgetting

moment
how

minutes
she
jumped
up
such
hurry
she
tipped
over
jurybox
edge
her
skirt
upsetting
all
jurymen
heads
crowd
below
there
they
lay
sprawling
about
reminding
her
very
much
globe

up

goldfish
kept
running
her

she
had
vague
sort
idea
they

be
collected
at
once

back
into

or
they
would
die
trial

not
proceed
said
king
very
grave
voice
until
all
jurymen
are
back
their
proper
places

he
repeated
great
emphasis
looking
hard
at
alice
he
said
do
alice
looked
at
jurybox
saw
her
haste
she
had
put
lizard
head
downwards
poor
little
thing
waving
its
tail
about
melancholy
way
being
quite
unable
move
she
soon
got
out
again
put
right
not
signifies
much
she
said
herself
i
should
think
would
be
quite
much
use
trial
one
way
up
other
soon
jury
had
little
recovered
from
shock
being
upset
their
slates
pencils
had
been
found
handed
back
them
they
set
work
very
diligently
write
out

when
white
rabbit
interrupted

he
said
very
respectful
tone
but
frowning
making
faces
at
him
he
spoke
unimportant
course
i
meant
king
hastily
said
went
himself
an
undertone
importantunimportant
unimportantimportant
if
he
were
trying
which
word
sounded
best
some
jury
wrote
down
important
some
unimportant
alice
could
see
she
near
enough
look
over
their
slates
but
doesnt
matter
bit
she
thought
herself
at
moment
king

had
been

said
king
jury
all
brightened
up
again
please
your

said
knave
i

theres
no

at

if

said
king
only
makes
matter
worse
you
must
have
meant
some
mischief
or
else
youd
have
signed
your
name
like
an
honest
man
there
general
clapping
hands
at
first
really
clever
thing
king
had
said
day
proves
his
guilt
said
queen
proves
nothing

said
alice
why

said
king
white
rabbit
put

he
trusts

obstacle

between
him

alice
got
up

off
thinking
while
she
ran
well
she
might
what
wonderful
dream
had
been
but
her
sister
sat
still
just
she
left
her
leaning
her
head
her
hand
watching
setting
sun
thinking
little
alice
all
her
wonderful
adventures
till
she
too
began
dreaming
after
fashion
her
dream
first
she
dreamed
little
alice
herself
once
again
tiny
hands
were
clasped
upon
her
knee
bright
eager
eyes
were
looking
up
into
hersshe
could
hear
very
tones
her
voice
see
queer
little
toss
her
head
keep
back
wandering
hair
would
always
get
into
her
eyesand
still
she
listened
or
seemed
listen
whole
place
around
her
became
alive
strange
creatures
her
little
sisters
dream
long
grass
rustled
at
her
feet
white
rabbit
hurried
bythe
frightened
mouse
splashed
his
way
through
neighbouring
poolshe
could
hear
rattle
teacups
march
hare
his
friends
shared
their
neverending
meal
shrill
voice
queen
ordering
off
her
unfortunate
guests
executiononce
more
pigbaby

while
plates
dishes
crashed
around
itonce
more
shriek
gryphon
squeaking
lizards
slatepencil
choking
suppressed
guineapigs
filled
air
mixed
up
distant
sobs
miserable
mock
turtle
so
she
sat
closed
eyes
half
believed
herself
wonderland
though
she
knew
she
had
but
open
them
again
all
would
change
dull
realitythe
grass
would
be
only
rustling
wind
pool
rippling
waving
reedsthe
rattling
teacups
would
change
tinkling
sheep

queens
shrill
cries

boyand

baby
shriek
gryphon
all
thy
other
queer
noises
would
change
she
knew
confused
clamour
busy
farmyardwhile
lowing
cattle
distance
would
take
place
mock
turtles
heavy
sobs
lastly
she
pictured
herself
how
same
little
sister
hers
would
aftertime
be
herself
grown
woman
how
she
would
keep
through
all
her
riper
years
simple
loving
heart
her
childhood
how
she
would
gather
about
her
other
little
children
make
their
eyes
bright
eager
many
strange
tale
perhaps
even
dream
wonderland
long
ago
how
she
would
feel
all
their
simple
sorrows
find
pleasure
all
their
simple
joys
remembering
her
own
childlife
happy
summer
days
